💬 Step 1: Understand and Confirm the Task
Say this to the interviewer:

“So if I understand the task correctly, I need to build a tab-based interface in React. It will have multiple tabs like ‘Tab 1’, ‘Tab 2’, etc., and when I click on a tab, its corresponding content should display while visually showing which tab is active. Please correct me if I missed anything.”

This shows:

You're an active listener.

You clarify requirements before jumping in.

🧠 Step 2: Explain Your Plan Briefly
“To achieve this, I’ll:

Create a list of tabs using an array.

Use state to keep track of the currently active tab.

Dynamically render the buttons for each tab.

Show the content of the currently selected tab.

Apply a simple active style to the selected tab for visual feedback.”

💻 Step 3: Start Coding with Line-by-Line Explanation
You can explain as you go:

```
import { useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
```
“I’m importing useState from React to manage which tab is active. Also importing a CSS file to style the active tab.”

```
function App() {
```
“Here’s the main component App.”

```
  const tabs = [
    { label: 'tab 1', content: <div>content of tab 1</div> },
    { label: 'tab 2', content: <div>content of tab 2</div> },
    { label: 'tab 3', content: <div>content of tab 3</div> },
    { label: 'tab 4', content: <div>content of tab 4</div> },
    { label: 'tab 5', content: <div>content of tab 5</div> },
  ]
```
“This array holds the data for each tab — a label for the button and content to be shown when the tab is active. I’m using JSX for content to render directly inside the component.”

```
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0)
```
“I’m initializing a state variable activeTab to 0, meaning the first tab will be active initially. setActiveTab will update the currently selected tab.”

```
  return (
    <>
```
“Inside the return, I’ll loop through the tabs array to render buttons.”

```
      {
        tabs.map((tab, index) => (
          <button
            className={index === activeTab ? 'active' : ''}
            key={index}
            onClick={() => setActiveTab(index)}
          >
            {tab.label}
          </button>
        ))
      }
```
“Each tab button:

gets its label from tab.label.

is styled with a class 'active' if it’s the current tab.

updates the state when clicked.”

```
      <div>
        {tabs[activeTab].content}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```
“Below the buttons, I render the content of the currently active tab using the index stored in activeTab.”



✅ Final Summary (Always end strong)
“So that’s the complete tab functionality. It’s dynamic, scalable to any number of tabs, and uses a clean separation of state and rendering logic. If needed, we could also extract this into separate components for better reusability.”

💡 Bonus Tips
Speak slowly and clearly.

If you make a small mistake, acknowledge and correct it — that shows professionalism.

If you’re stuck, explain your current thought process honestly.
